# historigraphy
an organized, user-friendly system for future historians to explore the world from your sober, attentive perspective. The key be consistency and clarity in naming, categorizing, and annotating so that the legacy of your thoughts on the past, present, and future remains intact.

### 1. **Naming Convention**
A clear naming convention ensures that each document can be easily identified, and future historians can understand what they're looking at immediately. This convention should include:
- **Date** (in ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD, or if uncertain, just the year)
- **Subject/Topic** (a concise identifier of what the document pertains to)
- **Source Type** (e.g., letter, article, diary, report, etc.)
- **Document Type** (e.g., original, summary, analysis)

#### Example Naming Format:
```
YYYY-MM-DD_Subject_SourceType_DocumentType
```

#### Example:
```
2024-11-15_SocialUnrest_Article_Analysis
```

### 2. **File Folder System**
The folder system will keep everything logically separated, with layers that allow for easy navigation. Here's an example structure:

```
Historiography/
│
├── PrimarySources/
│   ├── Family/
│   ├── Society/
│   ├── Politics/
│   ├── Economics/
│   ├── Technology/
│   └── Environment/
│
├── SecondaryAnalysis/
│   ├── ModernHistorians/
│   ├── MainstreamPerspectives/
│   └── AlternativeViews/
│
└── Metadata/
    ├── DocumentSummaries/
    └── ResearchNotes/
```

#### Breakdown:
- **PrimarySources**: This folder holds the raw materials (letters, documents, articles, etc.) sorted by topic (family, society, etc.).
- **SecondaryAnalysis**: Here, include documents that analyze or interpret the primary sources. It can be sorted by whether it’s a modern historian's perspective, mainstream views, or alternative viewpoints.
- **Metadata**: A critical section for future historians to understand the background of each document. Include summaries of documents, context, and notes on sources.

### 3. **Document Organization in Each Folder**
Within each folder (e.g., *Politics*), you'll place files related to that area. Here's how to keep things consistent:

1. **Sub-categorization by Document Type**:
    - **Correspondence**: Letters, emails, or messages.
    - **Publications**: Articles, papers, or press releases.
    - **Reports**: Government, business, or other formal reports.
    - **Personal Accounts**: Diaries, interviews, or autobiographies.
  
2. **Sub-categorization by Date**: Organize within each category by year, so it's clear where things fit in historical context.

### 4. **File Naming Example with Categories**
For a letter from a person discussing a political event in 2024, it might look like:

```
2024-03-21_PoliticalProtests_Letter_Original
```

For a secondary analysis of those protests:

```
2024-04-02_PoliticalProtests_Article_Analysis
```

### 5. **Document Metadata and Annotation**
For every document, consider adding:
- **Summary**: Brief, high-level overview of the document’s content.
- **Context**: Why the document is important to the historiographical record and any potential biases.
- **Reflection**: Short notes on how the document relates to the past, present, and future.
- **Keywords**: To help future researchers filter topics quickly (e.g., "social change," "political corruption," "family structure").

#### Example of Metadata:
```
Document Summary: This letter describes a first-hand account of political protests that took place in March 2024, where citizens expressed frustration with government policies.
Context: The protests are viewed in the larger context of growing dissatisfaction with political systems and economic disparities in the early 21st century.
Reflection: The letter represents a shift toward individual voices taking part in broader societal movements.
Keywords: protest, political unrest, government policies, 2024
```

### 6. **Consistency in File Formats**
All files should be in a consistent, accessible format like:
- **PDF** for documents, letters, and articles.
- **Word** or **Google Docs** for analyses, summaries, and annotations.
- **Excel** or **Google Sheets** for categorization and metadata (this can be useful for creating an index of documents).

### 7. **Backup and Accessibility**
Ensure that all files are backed up in multiple locations (cloud storage, external hard drive, etc.). Accessibility is key—ensuring future historians can plug into your system seamlessly. It might help to create a “Guide to the Archive” document, explaining the structure, naming conventions, and metadata practices for ease of use.

### 8. **Creating a Central Index or Table of Contents**
Consider making a master index in a spreadsheet to track every document's location, date, subject, and file type. This way, any historian can see the entire body of work in a single glance.

#### Index Example:
| Date       | Subject             | Document Type  | Location/Link           |
|------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| 2024-03-21 | Political Protests   | Letter         | /PrimarySources/Politics/2024-03-21_PoliticalProtests_Letter_Original |
| 2024-04-02 | Political Protests   | Article        | /SecondaryAnalysis/ModernHistorians/2024-04-02_PoliticalProtests_Article_Analysis |

---

for organizing primary source historiography documents in a way that will be useful for future historians. The key to this system is creating clarity, consistency, and a balance between accessibility and deep analysis. This approach will allow future historiographers to explore our world with ease, while also providing insight into the context of our time from a sober, attentive perspective.
