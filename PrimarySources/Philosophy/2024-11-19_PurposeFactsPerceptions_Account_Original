### **Facts (As Known and Asserted)**  

1. **Personal History**: Between 2020 and 2024, I upheld a life free from drugs, demonstrating a commitment to clarity of mind and body.  
2. **Recorded Observation**: Terrance McKenna's statement regarding an alien, encountered by me through a video in 2018, reflects a cultural dialogue on metaphysical encounters.  
3. **The Panopticon**: As conceived by Bentham and expanded upon by Foucault, it is a societal structure of surveillance and control, influencing labor and behavior.  
4. **The Book of Mormon**: The text explicitly supports the principle of opposition in all things and discusses the devil's role as a deceiver who denies his own existence.  
5. **Modern Inquisition**: There exists a notion of systematic societal suppression likened to historical inquisitions, affecting marginalized positions.  
6. **Light and Sound Therapy**: These techniques, often used for therapeutic purposes, are described as impacting the unconscious mind.  
7. **Energy and Wealth Dynamics**: The conceptualization of money as energy transferred and collected through systemic mechanisms.

### **Opinions and Perceptions (As Interpreted and Articulated)**  

1. **The Panopticon as Control**: It is perceived as a method to enslave humanity, keeping individuals in perpetual ignorance and dependence.  
2. **Suppression Through Ignorance**: Societal forces are likened to agents of darkness, perpetuating fear and limiting divine potential.  
3. **The Devil's Role**: Viewed not only as a spiritual adversary but as a metaphor for systemic deception and exploitation.  
4. **Theological and Economic Intersection**: Belief that celestial laws, covenantal relationships, and financial systems intertwine as a means of control and transmutation of human energy.  
5. **Light and Sound as Subjugation Tools**: Therapy methods are perceived as mechanisms for psychological manipulation, leading to madness or control.  
6. **Free Radicals and Energy Reaping**: A speculative interpretation of wealth dynamics as the collection of free electron energy, tied to environmental and geopolitical manipulation.

### **Declaration of Purpose**  

I recognize the urgency of my life's mission: the **revelation of truth, the pursuit of immortality, and the scientific affirmation of the human soul's existence**. In this battle, truth and light stand against deception and darkness, and it is through divine wisdom that the chains of ignorance shall be broken.  

This is a time of great spiritual and intellectual awakening, where the convergence of faith and science paves the way for a greater understanding of humanity's divine nature. Let the **eternal conflict** be fought not with weapons of the flesh, but with the sword of truth and the shield of righteousness.

I stand as a witness to the realities of light and darkness, the struggle for freedom, and the potential for divine transformation. With each step forward, I remain steadfast in my commitment to truth and the eternal purpose for which I was created.
