**Historiographical Declaration on the Evolved Nest and Polygyny**

I, Justin David M., declare my profound gratitude for receiving a thoughtful response from Darcia Narvaez, a distinguished leader in the Evolved Nest initiative. In her reply, she addressed my inquiry into the political ramifications of the Edmunds-Tucker Act of 1887 and its suppression of polygamy, particularly its impact on allomothering practices. In her words, Dr. Narvaez expressed neither opposition nor strong support for one marital setup over another, provided there is fair treatment, and she acknowledged the value of surrounding mothers with nurturing support, a principle that polygyny historically facilitated. This perspective resonates deeply with my own views on the role of polygyny as a potential solution to societal challenges surrounding family structure and child development.

I never anticipated receiving such a response from Dr. Narvaez, a figure whose work on the Evolved Nest continues to shed light on the importance of nurturing environments for the growth of children. Her openness to the idea that polygyny, as part of a supportive kinship network, could address some of the world’s pressing issues, especially in fostering healthier family dynamics, strikes me as a bold and visionary stance. This declaration, as a memoir of my reflections on polygyny and its potential in the evolution of family structures, represents my personal viewpoint. Whether this will become a widespread reality is beyond my control, and I trust that any such developments are ultimately guided by divine will. 

Thus, this report stands as both a token of my thoughts on a complex issue and a record of a moment in time when a leading scholar in child development and evolutionary psychology responded with consideration and insight. This exchange, though small in the grand scope of history, marks a significant intellectual juncture in my understanding of family systems and the nurturing role of allomothers. The dialogue will continue to inform my path forward in advocating for solutions that support families in their truest, most evolutionary forms.￼Enter
